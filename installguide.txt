# Git and Vercel Installation and Deployment Guide

This guide will help you set up Git for your project, publish it to GitHub, and deploy it to Vercel.

## 1. Local Git Initialization and Initial Commit

Your project is already initialized as a Git repository and has an initial commit. If you were starting a new project, the steps would be:

1.  **Initialize Git:**
    ```bash
    git init
    ```

2.  **Add all files to staging:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

3.  **Configure Git User Identity (if not already set):**
    ```bash
    git config user.email "your_email@example.com"
    git config user.name "Your Name"
    ```

4.  **Make the initial commit:**
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

## 2. Publishing to GitHub

To publish your local Git repository to GitHub:

1.  **Create a new repository on GitHub:**
    *   Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new).
    *   Choose a repository name (e.g., `convert-tool`).
    *   Keep it public or private as you prefer.
    *   **DO NOT** initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license, as your local project already has these.
    *   Click 'Create repository'.

2.  **Add the GitHub repository as a remote and push your code:**
    *   GitHub will provide you with commands after creating the repository. It will look something like this (replace `<YOUR_USERNAME>` and `<YOUR_REPO_NAME>` with your actual GitHub username and repository name):
        ```bash
        git remote add origin https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/<YOUR_REPO_NAME>.git
        git branch -M main
        git push -u origin main
        ```
    *   Execute these commands in your local terminal.

## 3. Deploying to Vercel

There are two main ways to deploy to Vercel: directly from the CLI or by linking to a GitHub repository.

### Option A: Deploying Directly from Vercel CLI

This option is useful for quick deployments or testing, but does not link to a Git repository for continuous deployment.

1.  **Install Vercel CLI (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    npm install -g vercel
    ```

2.  **Log in to Vercel:**
    ```bash
    vercel login
    ```
    Follow the prompts in your browser to log in with your Vercel account.

3.  **Navigate to your project directory:**
    Ensure you are in the root directory of your project (where `package.json` is located).

4.  **Deploy your project:**
    ```bash
    vercel deploy --prod
    ```
    This command will build your project and deploy it to Vercel. The `--prod` flag deploys it to your production domain. If you want a preview URL, you can omit `--prod`.

    Alternatively, to build locally first and then deploy the build folder:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    vercel deploy build --prod
    ```

### Option B: Deploying from GitHub (Recommended for Continuous Deployment)

This is the recommended approach for continuous deployment, where every push to your GitHub repository triggers a new Vercel deployment.

1.  **Ensure your project is published to GitHub** (as described in "2. Publishing to GitHub" above).

2.  **Connect Vercel to your GitHub repository:**
    *   Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new).
    *   Click on 'Continue with GitHub'.
    *   Grant Vercel access to your GitHub account (if you haven't already).
    *   Select the GitHub repository you just created (e.g., `convert-tool`).
    *   Vercel will automatically detect that it's a Create React App project and suggest the correct build settings. You can review and confirm.
    *   Click 'Deploy'.

    After the initial setup, any future pushes to your configured Git branches (e.g., `main`) will automatically trigger new deployments on Vercel.

After any successful deployment, Vercel will provide you with a URL where your application is live.
